# Cobra Clash

This repository contains the project files for our Software Design final project. We wanted to design a game inspired by the fan-favorite Snake game. This project was designed using the Model-View-Controller framework and each are contained in separate python scripts.

As the game progresses and players consumer more apples, their snake will grow in length, increasing the difficulty of navigating the board.
